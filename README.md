# FrogScout-App
A small app I made in high school for my robotics group. It was tailored around the FIRST Robotics Competition in 2018. The competition was video game themed that year, which influenced the design and art of the app. I made this in my senior year of high school with only a semester and a half of programming knowledge, so please excuse any awful practices and code that exist in this app. More details on that below.

This app was made for a competition held in a stadium with no internet access and with phones that had no SD cards, meaning (at least with my limited knowledge at the time) no decent way to save data. Therefore, I created an asinine way of saving data through appending data to a large StringBuilder, copying the String to the clipboard, and posting it to the notes section of the phone, which eventually was processsed by the accompanying program I wrote. The data was violatile and extremely prone to loss if the app was closed, or if the phone was somehow powered off. I fully recognize now that this is awful programming, but for the time it was the only answer I had with my limited conditions and knowledge. I would like to come back and fix this app up, but I'm not sure as to when that will be as I don't have an android phone, and because Android Studio is a pain to work with.
